### Project: JARVIS

JARVIS is a desktop application that allows a CS1101S TA to manage his/her students and tasks in an organised manner. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view the full list of students.
  * What it does: Allows the user to see the full list of students.
  * Justification: The default GUI that the user sees does not show the full list of students. Hence, this feature allows the user to view the full list to see all students in the system and their details recorded.
  * Highlights: to be added
