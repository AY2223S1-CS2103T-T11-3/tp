### Project: JARVIS

JARVIS is a desktop application that allows a CS1101S TA to manage his/her students and tasks in an organised manner. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add mastery check command
  * What it does: Allows the tutor to record the students' mastery check result
  * Justification: Tutor can keep track of student's mastery check completion statuses, a compulsory requirement for passing the module.

* **New Feature**: Add grade command
  * What it does: Allows the tutor to record the students' grades.
  * Justification: Recording the student's grades allows the tutor to easily identify weaker students who might require additional guidance.
